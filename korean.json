Our group of men have discovered several different types of treasure, some even from slaying the ravenous indigenous creatures that seem to roam these islands and caves. But we cannot seem to leave, we need more. The island demands it.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe next pages seem to be ripped out and missing.<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"We have failed. Many have perished.

Cross referencing other resources and even some older journals we have found references to deities, spirits, and even Gods. Most likely worshiped by the heathens that used to inhabit these lands. They seem connected to these islands somehow.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"The three names seem to be mentioned again and again, Wry, Da, and Aw.\""],

It appears as though no people are able to survive and thrive in these lands, like some force is forbidding human progress.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"These ravenous, unabating creatures are not helping matters, that's for sure.\""],
			"sandCasting": ["Sand Casting", "The entire book seems to be stained with various chemicals and powders.<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"Throughout my metallurgic experiments, I have found the best way to forge iron based tools, weapons, and ingots was to cast large amounts of material to shape it. The best casting method I have found using resources around me was sand casting.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"The primary ingredient for creating a sand cast is green sand, a mixture of clay flakes and refined sand. This allows for the malleability of creating the shape of tool and weapon heads, or even forming the ingots in which to work from.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"Next, we place the green sand in a flask, crafted with wood, sandstone, rock, or raw clay, finishing the build of the sand cast flask. We then set the shape, place down some talc powder so the finished produce can be lifted easier, and pour the molten smelted mixture into the cast to let it set and harden.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe book is adorned with crude drawings of each process.<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"I have also found I can use limestone powder as the flux to refine ores and remove impurities in the smelting process. Some carbon powder is also required to get a proper hardness to the finished metal.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe bottom of the paged is signed with \"James Townsend, the Smithy\"."],

It appears as they were in a similar state as myself; somehow trapped in these lands, struggling for our lives. In the many cases, these folks were not hostile, and we quickly made friendships.<br><br>\n\n\tWe traded goods and spoke on our situation. One of the folks drove a very hard bargain for some limestone that I needed. If I was a different type of person, given our secluded setting, I may have simply just taken it through \"other means\".<br><br>\n\t\n\tAlthough it was always my intent to return to them for trading, try as I might, I could no longer locate them. Either they moved on to other areas or died. Given the circumstances of these harsh lands, I’m guessing the latter is true."],

The snare and the deadfall become my most useful weapons.<br><br>\n\t\n\tI spent days crafting traps and placing them outside my shelter instead of focusing on traditional weaponry. My combat skills are not so great, and I have not found a meaningful resource to craft armor, so trapping appeared to be my best bet to dispatch these creatures.<br><br>\n\t\n\tI think I just heard my deadfall squish another giant spider. I'll write more on my improvised spider meat meal. Sadly, cooking is not my forte either."]
